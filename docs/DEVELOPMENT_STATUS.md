## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Critical logic in API (Vitest) and Worker (Go `testing`).
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, database interactions, and alerting flows.
- **E2E Tests**: Frontend user flows using Playwright.
- **Security Tests**: Dependency scanning and automated vulnerability checks.

## 📤 GitHub & Deployment Workflow

### Sycing to GitHub
To push your latest changes to GitHub, use the following commands:
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: implement 100-phase development roadmap and status doc"

# Push to the main branch
git push origin main
```

### Creating Feature Branches
Always develop new features in separate branches:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Then open a Pull Request on GitHub.
```
---

## 🐳 Docker Hub Usage

You can pull the latest pre-built images for the core components directly from Docker Hub:

```bash
# Pull the core API image
docker pull boniyeamin/netpulse-upguardx-api:latest
```

When new features are merged, the images are automatically updated (via the `push-images.sh` script).
